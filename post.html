		<h3>Mobile Learning Application</h3>

		<p>This was a project I implemented back in February-April(Spring) 2019 when I first learned AWS. I was the sole creator/developer of this project.
		<br>
		<br>
		The android application facilitated communication between faculties and students. There were functionalities of this application. Student could request faculty to enroll in a particular course. Faculty could enroll student in a particular course. Student and professors both can see their academic schedule. Student can also view grades posted by instructor. They can chat also. Also, I implemeted end-to-end encryption in the chat section using RSA algorithm where a sender sends the encrypted message with the help of public key and the receiver decrypts it using private key.   
		<br>
		<br>
		As a part of this project I also converted HTTP to HTTPS using Internet Information Services(IIS) Manager in Remote Desktop Connection. Thus providing a security feature.  
		<br>
		<br>
		I also implemented Application Load Balancer and Transactional Processing to provide data consistency and concurrency control in our system. 
		<br>
